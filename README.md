## Installation

We use Yarn 2.x please follow [the guidelines](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

### VSCode/VSCodium integration:

- Make sure to open ardrive-core.code-workspace
- Install recomended extensions (
  - arcanis.vscode-zipfs,
  - dbaeumer.vscode-eslint,
  - esbenp.prettier-vscode )

On repo main folder run:
```console
$ yarn
```

# Build

All compiled source files are in `lib/` with the same folder structure than `src/`.
For building the project you would run
```console
$ yarn build
```

That will compile both: the daemon service and the client

# Runninging the daemon

A service will start in daemon mode by doing

 ```console
$ yarn start
 ```

or

```console
$ yarn start-dev
```

to run the service in the current console and watch the file for changes.

# The client API

You access the daemon API by using the `ClientService` export of *ardrive-daemon*.

```ts
import { ClientService } from 'ardrive-daemon';
```

## Setup a client connection

`ClientService` is a singleton. It means any time you instantiate a new client that's the same instance within the module scope.

```ts
const service = new ClientService();
```

Before making any request to the already running daemon, the client has to connect:

```ts
await service.clientConnect();
```

That function will throw an error if the connection fails.

## Trigger actions

All endpoints are accesible by the `run` method.

```ts
const result = await service.run(endpointName: string, ...args: any);
```

**endpointName** must be the `name` property of a valid `Endpoint`, and the rest of the args are the ones that the endpoint handler function requests.

## Authentication

```js
// TODO
```

## Gracefully close the connection

After you have done all your stuff with the daemon connection, you can close de connection by doing:

```ts
service.disconnect();
```
